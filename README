This package contains configuration and script for the mandriva rpm.

Some file come from .in, this allow to transform path for testing purpose.
If your file or script contains path, you should make a .in files.

* About macros:
Only redefine macros in this package if the rpm one does not please to you.

All macros having same body should go into macros.in.
If the macros body change:
- add a symbolic value into macros-perarch.in (@foo@)
- add the value into make_macrosfiles.sh.in

Example:
%_libdir /use/%_lib => macros.in
%_lib lib|lib64 => macros-perarch.in

* Testing the monster

o First and easy way:
$ make test

o Live tests:

$ ./configure --with-rpmconfdir=$fakeroot --with-rpmlibdir=/usr/lib/rpm --with-rpmsysconfdir=/etc

This will configure the package for an installation into fakeroot, using rpm files in /usr/lib/rpm.
$ make
$ make install

Now we can say to rpm to use fake config:
rpm --rcfile $fakeroot/mandriva/rpmrc other command...

Happy Hacking
